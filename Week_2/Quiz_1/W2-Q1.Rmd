**Problem 1**

Which figure represents an overfitted model?

[**Figure 1**](Insert_Images/1A.png)  [**Figure 2**](Insert_Images/1B.png)  [**Figure 3**](Insert_Images/1C.png)

**Answer:** Figure 1

<br/>
**Problem 2**

**True or false**: The model that best minimized training error is the one that will perform best for the task of prediction on new data.

**Answer:** False

<br/>
**Problem 3**

The following table illustrates the results of evaluating 4 models with different parameter choices on some data set. Which of the following models fits this data the best?

**Answer:** Model 3

<br/>
**Problem 4**

Assume we fit the following quadratic function: f(x) = w0+w1*x+w2*(x^2) to the dataset shown (blue circles). The fitted function is shown by the green curve in the picture below. Out of the 3 parameters of the fitted function (w0, w1, w2), which ones are estimated to be 0? (Note: you must select all parameters estimated as 0 to get the question correct.)

**Answer:** w2

<br/>
**Problem 5**

Assume we fit the following quadratic function: f(x) = w0+w1*x+w2*(x^2) to the dataset shown (blue circles). The fitted function is shown by the green curve in the picture below. Out of the 3 parameters of the fitted function (w0, w1, w2), which ones are estimated to be 0? (Note: you must select all parameters estimated as 0 to get the question correct.)

![](Insert_Images/5.png)

**Answer:** w0 and w2

<br/>
**Problem 6**

Assume we fit the following quadratic function: f(x) = w0+w1*x+w2*(x^2) to the dataset shown (blue circles). The fitted function is shown by the green curve in the picture below. Out of the 3 parameters of the fitted function (w0, w1, w2), which ones are estimated to be 0? (Note: you must select all parameters estimated as 0 to get the question correct.)

![](Insert_Images/6.png)

**Answer:** none of the above

<br/>
**Problem 7**

Assume we fit the following quadratic function: f(x) = w0+w1*x+w2*(x^2) to the dataset shown (blue circles). The fitted function is shown by the green curve in the picture below. Out of the 3 parameters of the fitted function (w0, w1, w2), which ones are estimated to be 0? (Note: you must select all parameters estimated as 0 to get the question correct.)

![](Insert_Images/7.png)

**Answer:** w0

<br/>
**Problem 8**

Which of the following plots would you not expect to see as a plot of training and test error curves?

[**Figure 1**](Insert_Images/8A.png)  [**Figure 2**](Insert_Images/8B.png)  [**Figure 3**](Insert_Images/8C.png)

**Answer:** Figure 3

<br/>
**Problem 9**

**True or false**: One always prefers to use a model with more features since it better captures the true underlying process.

**Answer:** False
